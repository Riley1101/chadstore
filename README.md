## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Running backend server

Follow the instruction on [`Medusa backend Readme `](https://github.com/Riley1101/chadstore/blob/main/chad-medusa/README.md) at `/chad-medusa`
